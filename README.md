**The credential broker for AI agents.** Your agents ask. Your phone decides.

`jtk` is a local-first, open-source credential broker: a daemon holds your secrets and releases them to agents (or humans) only under a human-tunable policy — allow / ask / deny, per principal × credential × moment — with short-lived grants, a tamper-evident audit log, and one-tap approval from your phone. Values never leave your machine.

## Why

- Password-manager service accounts (1Password, Bitwarden) are vault-wide, read-only, and have no approval hook or per-item scoping — too coarse for local agents.
- Coding agents already have permission prompts for tools; secrets deserve the same treatment.
- 1Password items cannot reference each other — copies drift on rotation. junethekey credentials can soft-link: one value, many names, rotate once.

## How it works

```
agent --jtk get KEY--> daemon --allow + valid grant--> value (local hot path, <10ms)
                          |
                          ask
                          v
                     phone approval (tailnet web page, or self-hosted relay push)
                          |
                     Approve(ttl) / Deny  ->  grant  ->  value + audit row
```

## Compared to the closest prior art

| | secret-gate | junethekey |
|---|---|---|
| Backend | 1Password Connect server | local encrypted vault (zero external deps) |
| Identity | self-declared machine string | registered principals (ed25519 challenge-response) |
| Policy | none (asks every time) | allow/ask/deny matrix + TTL grants + first-use/value-changed |
| Tokens | 1Password SA (vault-wide) | self-issued, field→vault scope, :r/:w, any TTL |
| Values | pass through a public server | never leave your machine |
| Audit | logs | append-only JSONL + hash chain |

## Status & roadmap

In development (spec: [docs-spec.md](docs-spec.md)).

- **P0** policy engine — pure lib + `jtk simulate/why/test`
- **P1** daemon, vault, approval page (tailnet), relay (self-host), tokens, audit
- **P2** Touch ID, PWA, grant decay management
- **P3** MCP server, 1Password adapter

Distribution: npm (planned) + `bun build --compile` artifacts.

Clear is better than clever. `biome` and `bun test` must pass.
